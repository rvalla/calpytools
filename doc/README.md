# Cal Py Tools: documentation

This is a very brief documentation of the project. Remember that many tools you find here existed previously in
other of my projects (sometimes written in other languages). You can find information about all of them in
[musicaltools.gitlab.io](https://musicaltools.gitlab.io/index_en.html). If there isn't enough information
for you in the following files get in touch.  

- [**PCS()** and **pcs_cmd.py**](https://gitlab.com/musicaltools/calpytools/-/blob/themoststable/doc/pcs.md)
- [**Chain()** and **chain_cmd.py**](https://gitlab.com/musicaltools/calpytools/-/blob/themoststable/doc/chain.md)

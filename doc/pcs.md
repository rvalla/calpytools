# Cal Py Tools: PCS()

**PCS()** is the class of **Calpytools** that can analyze a set of notes and search for its *prime form*
in Allen Forte's database. It has some functions you can find useful apart from checking *pitch class sets*
clasification. You can use it directly in a terminal window running **pcs_cmd.py**.  

## pcs_cmd.py

If you run this tool you can decide either to run in *debug* mode or normaly. *Normal* mode will display
*pitch class set* information while *debug* mode will show some other data including candidates considered
when looking for the prime form. Little secret: if you type *forte* the program will analyse all prime forms
in the database (util if you note an error).

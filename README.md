# Cal Py Tools

This is a set of tools written in [Python](https://www.python.org) to work with *pitch class sets*, *pitch matrices* and other different ways to control musical discourse. Many tools you find here existed previously in other of
my projects (sometimes written in other languages). You can find information about all tools in
[musicaltools.gitlab.io](https://musicaltools.gitlab.io/index_en.html).
